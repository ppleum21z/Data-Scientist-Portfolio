## Machine Learning Project

- [Predict Credit risk customer](credit_risk_classification.ipynb)  
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a credit risk dataset to identify key variables and relationships. Preprocessed independent variables using Weight of Evidence (WOE) transformation and variable binning techniques. Developed and evaluated a classification model, achieving an 81% accuracy rate in predicting credit risk.

- [Loan Approval Prediction](loan_approval.ipynb)  
Designed and implemented a predictive model for loan approval classification as part of Kaggle's Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 10. Performed comprehensive EDA to uncover key features influencing loan approvals. Built and assessed a classification model, achieving an AUC score of 0.955.

- [Forecasting Mini-Course Sales]
Conducted EDA to analyze product sales variations across different stores and countries. Implemented various time series forecasting models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and deep learning models like MLP and LSTM. Evaluated model performance using the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), identifying XGBoost as the top-performing model with a SMAPE of 6.89.

## Deep Learning Project

- [90 Animal Classification](animal_classification.ipynb)  
Using Convolutional Neural Network to classifying images of animals into 90 different species. Leveraged transfer learning with the EfficientNet model as a feature extractor,
developed and assessed the classification model, achieving a notable accuracy rate of 91%
